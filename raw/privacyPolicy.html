                <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong
                            >Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong
                        >
                        - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains, in particular, special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. In addition, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss DSG:</strong> This privacy notice serves both to provide information under the Swiss DSG and under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that, due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss DSG such as "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR "processing" of "personal data" as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms is determined according to the Swiss DSG within the scope of its applicability.
                </p>

                <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
                <p>
                    We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. In addition, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.
                </p>

                <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
                <p>
                    In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that this data is transferred to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.
                </p>

                <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>
                    Data processing in third countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies (which can be recognized by the postal address of the respective provider or if the privacy policy explicitly refers to the data transfer to third countries), this is always done in accordance with the legal requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which was recognized as a secure legal framework by an adequacy decision of the EU Commission on 10.07.2023. In addition, we have concluded standard contractual clauses with the respective providers that comply with the requirements of the EU Commission and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dual protection ensures comprehensive protection of your data: The DPF forms the primary level of protection, while the standard contractual clauses serve as additional security. Should changes occur within the framework of the DPF, the standard contractual clauses serve as a reliable fallback option. In this way, we ensure that your data is always adequately protected, even in the event of political or legal changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each service provider, we inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and whether standard contractual clauses are in place. For more information on the DPF and a list of certified companies, please visit the website of the US Department of Commerce at
                    <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank"

                    (in English).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data transfers to other third countries, corresponding security measures apply, in particular standard contractual clauses, explicit consents or legally required transfers. Information on third country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found in the EU Commission's information offer:

                <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
                <p>
                    We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies in particular if the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require a longer storage or archiving of the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, data that must be kept for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that specifically apply to certain processing processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of multiple indications for the retention period or deletion periods of a date, the longest period shall always apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a period does not expressly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the event triggering the period is the date on which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship becomes effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data that is no longer needed for the originally intended purpose but is retained for legal reasons or other reasons is only processed for the reasons that justify its retention.
                </p>

                    The term "cookies" refers to functions that store and read information on users' devices.
                    Cookies may also be used for different purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security and
                    convenience of online offers, as well as creating analyses of visitor flows. We use cookies in
                    accordance with the legal regulations. For this purpose, we obtain, if necessary, the prior
                    consent of the users. If consent is not necessary, we rely on our legitimate interests. This
                    applies if storing and reading information is essential to provide explicitly requested
                    content and functions. This includes, for example, storing settings and ensuring the
                    functionality and security of our online offer. Consent can be revoked at any time. We provide

                    <strong>Notes on data protection legal bases: </strong>Whether we process personal data using

                    context of the respective services and procedures.

                        content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The user data
                        collected using cookies may also be used for reach measurement. Unless we provide
                        users with explicit information on the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g. in
                        the context of obtaining consent), they should assume that these are permanent and
                        the storage duration can be up to two years.

                    Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor flows
                    of our online offer and can include behavior, interests or demographic information about the
                    visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of the reach analysis,
                    we can, for example, determine when our online offer or its functions or content are used
                    most frequently, or invite repeated use. It also allows us to understand which areas need
                    optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to web analysis, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize
                    different versions of our online offer or its components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. data aggregated into a usage process, may be
                    created for these purposes, and information may be stored and read in a browser or on an
                    end device. The data collected includes, in particular, visited websites and the elements
                    used there, as well as technical information, such as the browser used, the computer system
                    used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their
                    location data, the processing of location data is also possible.

                <p>
                    In addition, the IP addresses of the users are stored. However, we use an IP masking
                    procedure (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the users. In
                    general, no clear data of the users (e.g. email addresses or names) is stored in the
                    context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, but pseudonymous data. This means
                    that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the
                    users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purpose of the respective
                    procedures.

                        user profiles are created by Google Analytics with information from the use of
                        different devices, whereby cookies can be used. Google Analytics does not log or store
                        individual IP addresses for EU users. However, Analytics provides rough geographic
                        location data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: City (and the
                        derived latitude and longitude of the city), continent, country, region, subcontinent
                        (and ID-based counterparts). For EU data traffic, the IP address data is used
                        exclusively for this derivation of geolocation data, before it is deleted
                        immediately. They are not logged, are not accessible and are not used for other
                        purposes. When Google Analytics collects measurement data, all IP queries are carried
                        out on EU-based servers before the traffic is forwarded to Analytics servers for
                        processing; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited,
